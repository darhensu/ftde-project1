This repo is my first mini project while participating Digital Skola Fast Track Mini Bootcamp, here's the case:

The data analyst team needs a table to create a dashboard detailing orders from the data source in the production marketplace database. As a data engineer, you are tasked with creating a data migration script to transfer the table from the source to the data warehouse, allowing the data analyst team to use the table from the data warehouse without burdening the production marketplace database.
